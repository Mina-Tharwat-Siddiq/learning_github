learn github
## Hello this is the first day in github, I learned how to make repo and get clone from it using following command:
### git clone ***-->(Link of repo)<--***
## This is the second day in github, my machine has 3 steps before remote repo , They are  [1] Working directory [2] Staging area [3] local repo first of all to know status about files where in those steps we use ---->***git status***<--
### To send data from **working area** to **staging area** we use command -->***git add -->(File name)<--***<-- or add all files -->***git add ***<-- ---- to cancle that action we use -->***git rest head (File name)<--***
### To send data from **Staging area** to **local repo** we use ***-->git commit -m "text to explain what I did"<--***
## third day: I learned the following commands:
### ***-->(git branch)<--*** We use it to know how many branches are avilable in local branch , ***-->(git remote -v)<--*** We use it to know the remote repo
